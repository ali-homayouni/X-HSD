        "In labeling, attention has been paid to two issues. First, some tweets are clearly offensive. Open insult 2 is an insult in which a person or persons are insulted by using a word or words. In contrast to this type of insult, we have implicit insult. Implicit insult is an insult in which a person insults a person or persons by using language expressions such as irony, metaphor and other language tools. Recognizing this type of insult and labeling it, unlike the first type of insult which is obvious, requires attention to the content of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some of the expressions used in themselves do not have an offensive meaning. These phrases appear in both explicit and implicit insults. In terminology, we call these expressions neutral expressions. The way these expressions are labeled is similar to implicit insult depending on the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes we come across insulting expressions that are widely used in society. For example, the use of the term \"بیشعور\" is abundantly seen in the speech of the elders of the society. In tagging, this frequency and how common the phrase is is not taken into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of hatred towards religion, we consider insulting the text of a religion as only offensive content. However, contrary to the definition of hateful content, we consider insulting the character of a religion or its elders to be hateful.

Two more questions left :) First, describe your hyperparameter selection process in words. If you based your process on any research papers or websites, please reference them. Why do you think the hyperparameters you ended up choosing worked better than others? Also, is there a significant discrepancy between your test and validation accuracy? Why do you think this is the case?\n",

        "Finally, perform an *error analysis* on your model. This is good practice for your final project. Write some code in the below code cell to print out the text of up to five test set examples that your model gets **wrong**. If your model gets more than five test examples wrong, randomly choose five of them to analyze. If your model gets fewer than five examples wrong, please design five test examples that fool your model (i.e., *adversarial examples*). Then, in the following text cell, perform a qualitative analysis of these examples. See if you can figure out any reasons for errors that you observe, or if you have any informed guesses (e.g., common linguistic properties of these particular examples). Does this analysis suggest any possible future steps to improve your classifier?"
